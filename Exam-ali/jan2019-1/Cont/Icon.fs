   Abstract syntax and interpreter for micro-Icon, a language where an 
   expression can produce more than one result.

   For a description of micro-Icon, see Chapter 11: Continuations, in
   Programming Language Concepts for Software Developers.

   As described there, the interpreter (eval e cont econt) has two
   continuations:

      * a success continuation cont, that is called on the result v of
        the expression e, in case it has one;

      * a failure continuation econt, that is called on () in case the
        expression e has no result.
